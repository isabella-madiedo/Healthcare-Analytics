### :bulb: Description
The objective of this report is to understand how certain mental health and life style indicators may be utilized in the identification of teenage depression cases, while controlling for gender and socioeconomic factors. For this purpose, the report leverages the data of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, 1994-2008 (Harris and Udry, 2018). Specifically, the analysis is based on Wave I of the dataset, which was conducted in 1994-1995 and included teenagers between the ages of 12 and 21 in the United States.

In recent years, and particularly in the context of COVID-19, mental health has escalated to the forefront of the world agenda. In this context, anxiety and depression are commonly identified as the most recurrent disorders. In fact, according to the Mental Health Foundation, “4-10% of people in England will experience depression in their lifetime” (Mental Health Foundation, 2022). Of these people, teenagers are of particular interest given their vulnerability to social, academic, and family pressures. Accordingly, the National Institute of Mental Health estimates that in 2020 “4.1 million adolescents aged 12 to 17 in the United States had at least one major depressive episode” (National Institute of Mental Health, 2021).
